## **Model Functions _Little App_**

Newbies: *Read this page then go to the "Data" tab on the bottom.*

In this app, you select a response variable and an explanatory variable,
as well as (optionally) a covariate.

The app automatically builds a model of  the response variable
in terms of the explanatory variable and covariate (if any).  The model
is displayed along with the data.

The first step (after reading this) is to go to the "Data" tab. There you can choose a library of data sets, a specific data frame from that library, and reponse and explanatory variables. The data and a model of the response in terms of the explanatory variables will be shown immediately.

The buttons near the top of the app allow you to 

- set the size n of the sample
- `r shiny::icon("dice")`: draw a new sample 
- `r shiny::icon("snowflake")`: freeze the current display so that you can compare it to new samples that you take. You can update the frozen display simply by pressing the button again.
- `r shiny::icon("signature")`: make model choices such as flexibility and model type
- Randomize the response variable, implementing a Null Hypothesis

At the bottom of the apps are several tabs that give different displays of the situation:

- *Explain*: This page explaining the app
- *Data*: Where you pick a data frame and response and explanatory variables. Doing this is **required**. You can't see your data until you say which data and variables you want.
- *Graph*: The main display of the current sample of data.
- *Compare*: Side-by-side displays of the current sample and the last sample frozen by you.
- *Stats*: Statistics summarizing the current sample (and the last sample frozen)
- *Codebook*: Documentation for the selected data frame


### Randomize response

Often, you want to compare the model you  got with the actual data to a model constructed with data simulated from the null hypothesis of no relationship between the response and explanatory variables. The simulated data is identical to the actual data *except* the response variable values have been shuffled.

For instance,  you might build a model with randomization OFF, then *freeze* the display. Next, turn randomization ON and compare the simulated results to the actual results you have already frozen.

### Statistics

This app automatically builds a model of the response variable as a function of the explanatory variable. The statistics shown are:

- the variance of the response variable
- the variance of the model values
- the sample size, n
- R^2^
- the degrees of flexibility of the model
- the F statistic

### Response and model values

You can tell the app to display the distribution of the response and model values. (See the Graph and Compare tabs.) The I-bar shows the mean Â± 1 and 2 times the standard deviation. (The variance, shown in the statistics report, is the square of the standard deviation.)
